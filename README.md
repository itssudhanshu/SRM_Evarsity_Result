# SRM Eversity Result API - Python(Flask-Tesseract OCR)
This Repository is an unofficial API for SRM Evarsity Result which is Online Portal for SRM University Katankulathur in order to show students their semester results. There was no official API of Evarsity Result when I wrote this piece of code.

## DEMO 
```
https://evarsity-sudhanshu.herokuapp.com/
```

## Getting Access Token Of User
```
http://evarsity-sudhanshu.herokuapp.com/result?regno=***************&date=*&month=*&year=****
```
Here I am using GET request but you may change the code to use POST requests. After giving all the necessary details in the url you can get the result in the form of JSON, which you can be used on any website.

<b><i>This Project is a testing feature for</i> SRM DOCKER <i>and still under development...</i></b>

## SRM Docker

#### The code might need to be changed if any changed have been made in the SRM Eversity website. If you find any bug please write to me about it.
